## Software Development Plan
---
### Description
Little Bee is a CLI application that allows the client to speak to and read from a database full of information about children within a childcare centre with speed and ease. Each child has a profile that contains information about them and their family.
### Purpose
Information management plays a large role within childcare as the industry is surrounded by laws and regulations, as well as being a sensitive industry in general. Records need to be kept for a minimum of 3 years even after a child has left and fast, simple access to information can play a crucial role in managing the information input and output of a business that may need to cater for over 100 children on a daily basis. The application isn't designed to look pretty, but is designed to minimise the steps required to finding access the desired information about a child. 

### Target Audience and Scenario of Use.
The target audience are employees of the childcare industry. Whether it be a:
-	Centre cook who needs to quickly find out whether a child is allergic to dairy.
-	or a Teacher who wants to find out Bobby's father's email so she can email her reports.
-	or an Administrator who would like to find out how old a child is, so she can be moved up on her birthday!
-	or a Director who needs to find phone information to discuss a certain issue.
In short, the target audience are employees of the childcare industry who are required to access information as a requirement of their role at work.

## User Interactions
---
The user interactions for this application are extensively controlled by the Ruby Gem, "tty-prompt". I chose this gem as it provides an easy form of navigation that is easy to use for both the developer and the client.

1. The user is introduced to a welcome page with the name of the application decorized in colour at the very top. The user is welcomed by: 
```
Welcome to Little Bee, User!
```
2. In the same page, the application informs the user that there is a restriction to who may access this information, as it is sensitive. Therefore the application will ask the user for a required response for their name. If the user name and password match the database given, the application allows access to the second stage of Little Bee with a confirmation message and a second prompt to navigate the application. 
```
Your identity has been confirmed!
Please navigate the application through the following menu:
```
3. Users can continue to navigate through the application through use of TTY prompt. An interesting use of TTY prompt has been that in the database section of the application, each menu option is related to the appropriate object of the class Child. Each menu option is "generated" from the database, and not typed in manually. 
```
  BACK
â€£ ID: 1 | Lindon De Lasci
  ID: 2 | Nicolas Sheardown
  ID: 3 | Jose Heimes
```
4. Finally, when the user has sorted through the child database, appropriate information about the child will be pulled out in response to the option that has been selected. For example, Selecting the name "Lindon De Lasci" will then look for the child profile with the "ID" attribute of 1. And in response, will print out the appropriate information of the child selected, with no further input required from the user.
